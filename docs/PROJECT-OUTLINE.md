# 🚀 Project Title: AutoPilotOps – AI-Driven Self-Healing Cloud Infrastructure

🎯 Problem it Solves:
Traditional systems react to failures; they don't prevent them.

Manual deployments introduce inconsistencies and delays.

Current monitoring stacks lack predictive intelligence.

🧠 What We'll Build:
AutoPilotOps is a fully autonomous cloud infrastructure platform featuring:

AI-Powered Predictive Monitoring System

Uses ML models to detect anomalies, forecast failures, and automatically initiate recovery actions.

Integrates with Prometheus, Grafana, and logs via OpenTelemetry.

Model training with historical log and metric data (e.g., LSTM, Isolation Forests).

Intelligent CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions or GitLab CI → ArgoCD → Helm → Kubernetes (EKS or GKE).

Auto-rollbacks based on AI-driven anomaly detection in deployment health.

Self-Healing Cloud Infrastructure

Uses Kubernetes Operators and custom controllers to:

Auto-replace failed pods/nodes intelligently.

Predictively scale workloads using AI models (based on usage trends).

Perform preemptive updates/upgrades during low-risk windows.

Infra-as-Code with AI-based Drift Detection

Terraform + GitOps with automated drift detection (AI-enhanced) and auto-correction.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Area Tools & Tech
Cloud Platform AWS or GCP
Monitoring & Telemetry Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry
AI/ML Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, MLflow
Infra Automation Terraform, ArgoCD, Helm
CI/CD GitHub Actions / GitLab + Kubernetes (EKS/GKE)
DevOps Enhancements KEDA (event-driven autoscaling), Kubernetes Operators
Logging & Alerting Loki, Alertmanager, Slack/MS Teams Integration

💡 Key Features to Showcase:
📈 Predictive alerts before failures using time series anomaly detection.

🔄 Auto-healing Kubernetes services (e.g., restart pods, shift traffic).

🔧 AI-augmented rollback/roll-forward decisions in CI/CD.

🔐 Drift detection + self-remediation of cloud resources via Terraform.

🧪 Optional Add-Ons:
Real-time dashboard with model predictions and incident timelines.

CLI tool: autopilotctl to interact with the system and trigger workflows.

AI-enhanced documentation generator based on incident logs + telemetry data.

✅ What You'll Learn (and Employers Will Love):
How to integrate AI/ML in real-world DevOps workflows.

Designing cloud systems that think, adapt, and recover autonomously.

Best practices in cloud-native DevOps: GitOps, Helm, Kubernetes, observability.

Building intelligent CI/CD with rollback strategies driven by metrics.
