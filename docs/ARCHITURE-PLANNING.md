# 📅 Phase 1: Architecture & Planning

## ✅ Step 1: Define System Architecture

We’ll map all the major components:

- CI/CD pipeline

- AI monitoring engine

- Self-healing infra (K8s Operator/Controller)

- Logging/Telemetry stack

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform

- Dashboard/CLI (optional, future phase)

## ✅ Step 2: Decide Tech Stack & Tools

Finalize cloud provider (AWS or GCP), choose monitoring tools (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), AI tools (Python + MLFlow or SageMaker), etc.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer

### ✅ Step 3: Provision Cloud Resources

- Use Terraform to provision:

- Kubernetes Cluster (EKS/GKE)

- S3/GCS for log storage

- IAM roles, VPC, etc.

### ✅ Step 4: Install Observability Stack

- Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager

- OpenTelemetry Collector

- Loki for logs

## 🤖 Phase 3: AI-Powered Monitoring System

### ✅ Step 5: Collect Training Data

- Simulate logs and metrics

- Store datasets in object storage or local ML environment

### ✅ Step 6: Build ML Model

- Train anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, Prophet, LSTM)

- Deploy with FastAPI or Flask

### ✅ Step 7: Integrate with Monitoring Stack

- Model reads from Prometheus/Loki and triggers actions based on predictions

## 🚀 Phase 4: CI/CD and Auto-Remediation

### ✅ Step 8: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions → ArgoCD → Helm

- Build, test, deploy apps with health checks

- Tie in AI model results to auto-rollback via custom scripts

### ✅ Step 9: Kubernetes Self-Healing Operator

- Operator watches for predicted issues and initiates:

- Auto-scaling

- Pod restarts

- Preemptive rollbacks

## 📊 Phase 5: Visualization + Documentation

### ✅ Step 10: AI Ops Dashboard (Optional)

- Visualize predictions, alerts, metrics in a user-friendly UI

- Deploy Grafana + custom panels

### ✅ Step 11: Document Everything

- GitHub README with diagrams

- Architecture, workflows, CI/CD pipelines, AI integration notes

## 🔄 Iteration & Testing

- Simulate edge cases (pod crash, spike in traffic, CPU leak)

- Validate AI and self-healing response
